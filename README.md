# HandwritingRecognition ‚úçÔ∏è

An Intelligent system for identifying the writer based on the handwriting patterns and characteristics.

## Overview üéØ
The system analyzes unique writing patterns and characteristics to determine the identity of the writer. Using advanced machine learning techniques, it can recognize individual writing styles and authenticate the author of handwritten text.
